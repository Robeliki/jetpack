== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I already have a WordPress account, but it's not working, what's going on? =

Jetpack requires a connection to [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/) to enable all features. This is a different account than the one you use to log into your self-hosted WordPress. If you can log into http://wordpress.com, then you already have a WordPress.com account. If you can't, then you can easily create one as part of the installation of Jetpack.

= How do I view my stats? =

Once you've installed Jetpack, your stats will be available via the "Site Stats" menu which appears in the new Jetpack menu (under your Dashboard menu within WordPress).

= How do I embed media? =
